# linq-exercises
Linq exercises for beginners, supported by tests.

This project is aimed at c#/linq beginners, though you can use those drills to polish your skills regardless of your level.

I hope'll enjoy it and that you'll find this project as valuable learning resource.

You can read more about it here [Learn/Teach LINQ using TDD/TDL](https://softdevpractice.com/blog/learn-teach-linq-using-tdd-tdl/)

Have fun :)
